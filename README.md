Rmaxmind
========

Pure R implementation for reading and processing (legacy) MaxMind IP Geolocation data 


While not a full-on R package, the routines in maxmind.R will enable the user to

- download the MaxMind CSV data sets (so, the _legacy_ data format)
- perform ASN, CC & City queries
- optionally cache results (provided you are using redis) IP geolocation

I'll _eventually_ convert this to a package once the book : http://amzn.to/sudabook : that @jayjacobs & I are writing comes out :-)
